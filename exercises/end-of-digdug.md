# The end of Dig Dug.

Chances are, your Dig Dug page is full of random attempts at getting things to cooperate.  Some successful, and some not, but either way, it's a collection of your efforts so far this semester.  We want to see what you've accomplished (or at least tried).  

## Submit your work.

1.	Upload it to your banjo account in the 235 directory.  You can leave it in the ‘game’ directory or you can make a new directory.
2.	You should zip up your complete game directory (with images, css, second html page, favicons, etc).
3.	Go to myCourses and submit the zip file to the Assignment titled “HTML Lab Work”
4.	In the Comments field, supply the URL to the page live in your banjo account.
